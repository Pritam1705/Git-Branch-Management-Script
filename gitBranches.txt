Write a script to manage branches
    - Must
        - List branches
        - Create branch
        - Delete branch
        - Merge 2 branches
        - Rebase 2 branches
e.g:
```
./gitBranches.sh  -l 

output: 
master 
ninja

./gitBranch.sh -b <branch_name>
./gitBranch.sh -d <branch_name>
./gitBranch.sh -m -1 <branch_name1> -2 <branch_name2> ----> which means branch_name1 branch is going to merge into branch_name2 branch 
./gitBranch.sh -r -1 <branch_name1> -2 <branch_name2>---- which means branch_name1 branch is going to rebase on branch_name2 branch
